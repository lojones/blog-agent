        Queries the Perplexity AI API for information discovery and research.
        
        This function leverages Perplexity AI's capabilities to process natural language queries
        and return comprehensive, synthesized answers from multiple sources. The API provides:
        - Enhanced web searching with direct, comprehensive answers
        - In-depth research capabilities with source verification
        - Content creation and summarization features
        - Real-time information processing
        - Fact-checking with citations
        
        Args:
            query (str): The natural language query to send to Perplexity AI
            
        Returns:
            dict: Response from Perplexity containing:
                - answer: Synthesized response to the query
                - citations: List of sources used
                - relevance_score: Confidence score of the answer
                
        Raises:
            Exception: If the API call fails or returns invalid response
            
        Example:
            tool = PerplexityTool()
            response = tool.query("What are the latest developments in AI?")
            print(response['answer'])
